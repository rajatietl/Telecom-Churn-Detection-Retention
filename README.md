Customer acquisition and retention is a key concern for the telecommunication company. With the advent of innovative technologies and fierce competition, the choices for customers to choose from have increased tremendously in number. In the telecommunication industry, where deregulation is at its peak. Every year a new company springs up offering fitter options for its customers which leads to customer churn. Churn could happen due to many different reasons and churn analysis helps to identify the cause (and timing) of this.

Traditional surveys based on running questionnaires or interviews suffer from a high cost, limited access to customer population and data self-reporting. Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts. This gives you the ability to pattern habits of customers who leave, and step in before they make that decision. Without this tool, you would be acting on broad assumptions, not a data-driven model that reflects how your customers really act.

Our approach use AI and machine learning model for churn detection and retention.
Our approach consist of two modules:
1. Predictive Churn Model: It is a straightforward classification tool which looks at the user activity from the past and checks to see who is active after a certain time and then create a model that probabilistically identifies the steps and stages when a customer (or segment) is leaving your service or product.
2. Retention Model: This model gives the details which factor most influence the churning of the customer and where to focus and not to focus.
